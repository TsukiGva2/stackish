# Commenting Style

I do it in a quite quirky way, but it makes
sense for me right now. This is just a quick
write-up for me to keep track of my schizophrenic
comments.
---

## COMMENT TYPES

- FIXME -> To be fixed, WIP
- TODO  -> To be done, important stuff
- NOTE  -> General comments, thoughts, ideas, etc
- XXX   -> Hacks, suboptimal approaches, unreadable monsters, etc

### CUSTOM COMMENT ATTRIBUTES
---

- @IMPROVEMENT  -> Improvement to the code, readability/modularity
- @OPTIMIZATION -> Optimization ideas/suggestions, and just insults if i want
- @WIP          -> Unfinished code, work in progress (like this whole branch)
- @OVERSIGHT    -> Things i'm too lazy to do right now but are important and will be done
